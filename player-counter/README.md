# Player Counter (by Boy132)

Show the amount of connected players to game servers with real-time querying capabilities.

## Setup

Make sure your server has an allocation with a public ip. Alternatively, if you use local ips you can put the public ip in the allocation alias and enable "Use allocation alias?" in the plugin settings. Using a domain as allocation alias or `0.0.0.0`/`::` as allocation ip will not work!

For each game you need to create a Game Query in the admin area.

### Minecraft

Minecraft servers will first try the query (which requires you to set `enable-query` to true and `query-port` to your server port in `server.properties`) and will fallback to ping. It is recommended to enable query.

### Minecraft Proxy (Velocity/BungeeCord/Waterfall)

Use the `Minecraft (Proxy)` query type when the server you are querying is actually a Velocity, BungeeCord or Waterfall proxy sitting in front of one or more backend servers, instead of a standalone Minecraft server. All three proxies speak the same Java Edition status/ping protocol as a vanilla server, so this query type returns the aggregated player count/list across all backend servers behind the proxy.

Unlike the `Minecraft (Java)` type, this always uses the ping/status protocol only and never attempts the legacy `enable-query`/`query-port` query, since proxy software does not support that legacy query protocol reliably (it caused connection errors during testing). No proxy-side query configuration is needed.

Since a proxy has no `whitelist.json`, `ops.json` or player data files of its own, the whitelist, OP list and player avatar features on the players page are disabled for this query type. Kick and ban are disabled too, since stock Velocity/BungeeCord/Waterfall don't provide those console commands out of the box. Whitelist/OP/kick/ban management still works normally when applied directly to the backend servers using the regular `Minecraft (Java)` query type.

### Palworld

For Palworld servers you need to set `RESTAPIEnabled` to `true` and `RESTAPIPort` to your server port in `PalWorldSettings.ini`. You also need to set an admin password via the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` startup variable.
